# Student Resources

## What the heck is everything in here

  file           |  explaination
-----------------|--------------
pages.txt        | Contains a list of URLS to be used for the assignments
makebasefiles.sh | Downloads and processes URLS listed in `pages.txt`, outputting them to `basefiles/`
redohtml/        | Code designed to pull content out of specific web pages, putting them into our own frame.
home/            | Files that will be copied to student's `$HOME`

## How this works?

* Run makebasefiles.sh
* Edit the pages in `basefiles/` to our liking.
* Place them in `home/`
