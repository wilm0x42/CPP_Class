# C++ Class
This repo contains all the tools and resources I'm creating and using for the C++ class I teach.

Here's a summary of what you'll find in the root of this repo:

* `docs/` - Contains the website for the class. This is generated
by jekyll, but I haven't added the source files for that to the repo yet.
* `QTeach/` - Sources for the program I wrote to give presentations on the fly.
I mostly use this for lectures.
* `QTeach-bin` - Linux binary of QTeach, for convenience.
* `student-resources` - Various resources that'll be given to students for the class. (assignments, etc.)
