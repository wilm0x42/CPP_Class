# C++ Class - now defunct
This repo contains all the tools and resources I was creating and using for the C++ class I taught.

Here's a summary of what you'll find in the root of this repo:

* `docs/` - Contains the website for the class. This is generated
by jekyll, but I haven't added the source files for that to the repo yet.
* `QTeach/` - Sources for the program I wrote to give presentations on the fly.
I mostly use this for lectures.
* `QTeach-bin` - Linux binary of QTeach, for convenience.
* `student-resources/` - Various resources that'll be given to students for the class. (assignments, etc.)
* `multi-user-ide/` - Browser-based IDE to allow several students to work on the same program at once.
