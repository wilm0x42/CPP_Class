<h3 id="whats-being-taught">What’s being taught</h3>

<p>Over the course of one semester, I’ll teach students how to
write computer programs using the C++ programming language.
Some of the initial topics we’ll go over include: compilers,
structure of a program, and basic input/output. By the end
of the semester, we’ll move on to more advanced topics like
efficient flow control, arrays, and data structures.</p>

<p>I’ll give lectures based on tutorials at <a href="http://cplusplus.com">cplusplus.com</a>,
supplemented by examples and assignments, all along the way.</p>

<h3 id="how-its-being-taught">How it’s being taught</h3>

<p>There will be two separate classes each week, both of which
take place at my home from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>The intro class, which will be on Thursdays, is for new students.
In this class, I’ll explain the C++ language from the ground up.
Once the semester is over, the students of this introductory course
will be able to move on to the advanced class.</p>

<p>On Mondays, we’ll have an advanced class for students who already have a
basic understanding of the C++ language. Here, we’ll pursue any
topics students are interested in, such as various extension
libraries for C++.</p>

<h3 id="where-and-when">Where and When</h3>
<p>Our home address is <strong>3618 Sleepy Hollow Rd., Wake Forest, NC 27587.</strong></p>

<p>Sorry in advance for our long and treacherous driveway. ;)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intro Class: Each Thursday from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.</li>
  <li>Advanced Class: Each Monday from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.</li>
  <li>First week of classes: January 15th and 18th, for the advanced and intro classes, respectively.</li>
  <li>Last week of classes: TBA</li>
</ul>

<p>Please keep in mind that, while these are <em>probably</em> the
dates and times when class will be held, we’ll be happy
to adjust everything to best fit everyone’s needs.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>$10 per NEW student for a flash drive. <em>Details on this below.</em></li>
  <li>Laptop computer capable of connecting to the internet. (We can accommodate wired connections, if necessary.)</li>
  <li>Current membership with Lighthouse Christian Homeschool Association</li>
  <li>Primarily meant for high schoolers, but computer-savvy middle schoolers are also welcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>The class will cost $10 for all new students; this is because each
student will be given a flash drive containing a Linux-based live
operating system. It’s unnecessarily difficult to install a software
development environment on a computer running Windows, let alone 10
of them. (Each with their own unique problems.) To
remedy this, each student will be running identical copies of the
same operating system, which will already have all the necessary tools
installed and ready to use.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or check, when you drop your kid(s) off.
Of course, there should be no class fee for the
advanced class, because returning students should have already
received a flash drive.</p>

<h3 id="sign-up">Sign up</h3>
<p>If your child would like to join the class, just send an email
to <strong>my mom</strong>, letting us know you’re interested, and we’ll follow
up with all remaining details. <em>Contact information below</em></p>
