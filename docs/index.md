## About the class

### What's being taught

Over the course of one semester, I'll teach students how to
write computer programs using the C++ programming language.
Some of the initial topics we'll go over include: compilers,
structure of a program, and basic input/output. By the end
of the semester, we'll move on to more advanced topics like
efficient flow control, arrays, and data structures.

I'll give lectures based on tutorials at [cplusplus.com](http://cplusplus.com),
supplemented by examples and assignments, all along the way.

### How it's being taught

There will be teach two separate classes each week; both will
take place at my home from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.

The intro class, which will be on Mondays, is for new students;
in this class, I'll explain the C++ language from the ground up.
Once the semester is over, the students of this introductory course
can move on to the advanced class.

On Thursdays, we'll have an advanced class for students who already have a
basic understanding of the C++ language. Here, we'll pursue any
topics students are interested in, such as various extension
libraries for C++.


### Where and When
Our home address is **3618 Sleepy Hollow Rd, Wake Forest.**

Sorry in advance for our long and treacherous driveway. ;)

* Intro Class: Each Monday from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.
* Advanced Class: Each Thursday from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.
* First week of classes: TBA

### Requirements
* $10 per NEW student for a flash drive. _Details on this below._
* Laptop computer capable of connecting to the internet. (We can accommodate wired connections, if necesary.)
* Current membership with Lighthouse Christian Homeschool Association
* Primarily meant for high schoolers, but tech-savvy middle schoolers are also welcome.

The class will cost $10 for all new students; this is because each
student will be given a flash drive containing a Linux-based live
operating system. It's unnecesarily difficult to install a software
development environment on a computer running Windows, let alone 10
different Windows boxes, each with their own unique problems. To
remedy this, each student will be running identical copies of the
same operating system, which will already have all the necesary tools
installed and ready to use.

Of course, there is no class fee for returning students that
have already received a flash drive.
